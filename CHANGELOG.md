# Changelog

All notable changes to *Resistance in the Shackles* are recorded here. The headline deliverable is the **[System Reference](System%20Reference/README.md)** (the master ruleset); [`Shareable Editions/`](Shareable%20Editions/README.md) holds the recipe for player-facing primers, and the surrounding folders hold source and ideation material.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Dates are ISO (YYYY-MM-DD). When you change a rule, add a bullet under **[Unreleased]** and reference the Part you touched.

## [Unreleased]

- _Nothing yet._

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-17

Reworked the player primer to read as a surface-level mystery, and fixed sub-ability formatting.

### Changed

- **Player primer is now strictly player-facing.** The assembler strips all design/balance commentary and the mechanical scaffolding that pulled back the curtain — the beats/zenith framing, the **Downfall** explanation, "a character does not know they have beats", and the per-class balance notes. Each calling's **zenith beats** and each class's **zenith abilities** are cut from the primer (kept in the System Reference), so the endgame stays a mystery revealed in play. Curated, in-fiction chapter intros replace the structural README sections; the callings' "choosing" guide, the class list, and the ancestry culture/kindred tables are retained.
- **Class sub-abilities format correctly.** A major ability's sub-options now render as a proper list — each on its own line with a **bold name** — instead of a run-on block. Root cause (markdown needs a blank line before a list) is fixed both in the assembler and, generally, in the reusable builder (`ensure_blank_before_lists`), and recorded as pitfall #10 in `Shareable Editions/build/BUILD.md`.
- Rebuilt `player-primer.{md,html,pdf}` accordingly (~154 A5 pages).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-17

Made the designed-document build process reusable and repeatable.

### Added

- **`Shareable Editions/build/`** — a reusable toolkit for compiling any Markdown into a themed HTML + A5 print PDF:
  - `build_designed_doc.py` — generic CLI builder (Markdown → themed, self-contained HTML → A5 PDF) with every markdown→print pitfall handled.
  - `shackles_cards.py` — the per-track / per-domain / per-skill colour-card theme module.
  - `shackles.css` — the full design-language stylesheet (screen + `@page` print; compass motif embedded).
  - `BUILD.md` — the runbook and a **"do not repeat"** pitfalls list (no `nl2br`; inject raw HTML pre-conversion; demote headings vs. wrapper divs; neutralise internal links; A5 via `@page`; verify by rendering; the `.gitignore` `*.pdf` exception; the OneDrive lock-sweep).
- Also packaged as an installable Cowork **skill** (`designed-document.skill`) delivered separately, so the same process can be invoked directly in future sessions.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-17

The first shareable player primer.

### Added

- **`Shareable Editions/Player Primer/`** — *Blood, Water & Violent Wind*, the first compiled player primer, built per the content spec and design language:
  - **`player-primer.html`** — a single-file, responsive, fully themed HTML edition (parchment, oxblood banners, the per-track and per-domain colour system, woodcut headers, compass motif). Best for Discord and phones; reflows to any screen.
  - **`player-primer.pdf`** — an A5 single-column print PDF rendered from the same source (~165 pages).
  - **`player-primer.md`** — the assembled Markdown source, and **`build/`** — the two scripts (`assemble_primer.py`, `theme_primer.py`) that regenerate both exports from the System Reference.
  - Contents: premise, world, how-to-play, the five tracks, skills & domains, all callings, all classes, all ancestries, character creation, and a quick-reference card. GM-only material excluded.
- **`.gitignore`** exception so the compiled primer PDF is tracked despite the global `*.pdf` rule.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Planetouched** — a sixth ancestry kindred (tieflings, aasimars, and the elemental-blooded — ifrits, undines, oreads, sylphs): people marked at birth by a heritage they did not choose, who refuse to be the thing their blood says they are. Mechanics-free, with a lore block, three world-anchored questions, names, and a d20 trinkets table. Added to the ancestries index, character creation, README, primer spec, and navigation.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-17

The last polish — the cohesion roadmap is now fully closed.

### Added

- **Part Two — Combat at Character Scale** — a short section making the fight-running loop explicit: no turn order, taking a foe out at Resistance 0, range and position as fiction, ganging up via difficulty, fighting hurt, and surrender/capture. Points to Parts Ten and Fourteen.
- **Part Two — "Three ways to recover"** — a one-paragraph pointer consolidating where healing lives (Tend gear, haunts & bonds, rest), so "how do I heal this?" is findable in one place.
- **Character sheet in the tree** — the [`character-sheet.md`](System%20Reference/character-sheet.md) build brief now lives in the repo, framed as the sheet spec and linked from Part Eight and the README; drop the generated sheet beside it when produced.

### Changed

- **Cohesion gap analysis** marked **complete**: every identified gap is closed and the System Reference is a self-contained game. The only remaining work is deliberately optional (more ancestries; a full setting gazetteer).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-17

Polish: a one-page card and a set of ready-to-run places.

### Added

- **Quick Reference** ([`quick-reference.md`](System%20Reference/quick-reference.md)) — the whole game on one page: the roll and result band, difficulty, marking stress and the fallout check, the five tracks (and how each clears), the four gates, the equipment ladder and common tags, the skills/domains lists, and beats/advancement. Linked from the top of the README; built to double as a shareable-edition back page. (Unnumbered card, outside the linear part order.)
- **Part Fifteen — Worked Landmarks** — ready-to-run statblocks on the Part 11/12 templates: havens (Port Peril, Tidewater Cove, Bloodcove), the wild and the ruins (the Green Throat interior delve, the Drowned Vault of Azlant), and the deep (the Edge of the Eye, the Crosswind Shoals), each with a one-line "use," plus a build-your-own frame.

### Changed

- **Cohesion gap analysis** updated: the quick reference and worked landmarks are in; remaining is light polish (a short combat/recovery summary, and the character sheet in-tree).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-17

The third and last structural gap closed: opposition to point at the crew.

### Added

- **Part Fourteen — Adversaries** — generalises the adversary statblock off the ship case (DIFFICULTY / RESISTANCE / PROTECTION / STRESS + tags / RESOURCES / MOVES; no rounds; mobs as one Resistance; Legendary threats as arc-length weather), with a calibration box for stat ranges. Includes an original starter bestiary of ~20 Shackles threats:
  - **People of the Inner Sea** — Chelish naval officer, colonial marines, Aspis enforcer and factor, Rahadoumi Pure Legion zealot, press-gang, sea-witch.
  - **Beasts of the Shackles** — reef shark pack, reef lurker, brine-scuttler, jungle predator, bloodfly swarm, great squid.
  - **The Drowned & the Deep** — the Drowned, ghost-light, Ghol-Gan stone sentinel, trench-thing, revenant of the Code.
  - **Legendary Threats** — *Old Sorrow* (a leviathan), *What the Eye Keeps* (a storm-bound horror), *The Lord-Admiral's Hound* (a pirate-hunter and her warship).

### Changed

- **Cohesion gap analysis** updated: all three structural gaps (ancestries, GM chapter, bestiary) now closed — the System Reference stands on its own as a complete game. Remaining items are polish (combat/healing consolidation, a quick-reference page, worked landmarks, the character sheet in-tree).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-17

Added the GM half of the game.

### Added

- **Part Thirteen — Running the Game** — the GM chapter, consolidating front matter that was previously scattered across the rules: the GM's job and principles; when to call for a roll; setting difficulty; the craft of **assigning stress and choosing the track**; **framing fallout** as concrete fiction; **pacing the doom** (running Luck and the callings' Downfalls honestly, and never telling a player their beats); building landmarks, haunts, journeys, and adversaries from the templates; a **session-zero** procedure with safety tools; and running beats and advancement. Ends with a first-session checklist.

### Changed

- **Ancestries:** removed the proposed "Drowned" expansion kindred and recorded the reason — being claimed by the sea and returning not-quite-human is the **Tide** track's gravest stake and the heart of *Cursed Tides*; it must remain a fate, never a character-creation option. Noted in the ancestries index and the gap analysis.
- **Cohesion gap analysis** updated: Running the Game marked resolved; remaining roadmap is the adversary bestiary, then the smaller polish items.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-17

Reworked Ancestries into a two-tier **cultures + kindreds** model.

### Changed

- **Part Seven — Ancestries** restructured. **Cultures** (for humans, elves, half-elves and the like — defined by upbringing, not species; there is no standalone "human" or "elf" ancestry): **Shackleborn**, **Bonuwat**, **Chelaxian**, each now noting it is a culture open to multiple species. **Kindreds** (peoples set apart by nature):
  - **Small Folk** — merges halfling, gnome, and dwarf into the small "ordinary" peoples (was *Halfling*).
  - **Big Folk** — merges half-orc, minotaur, and hobgoblin into the large martial peoples (was *Half-Orc*).
  - **Beast-folk** — merges tengu, catfolk, ratfolk, merfolk, and naga into the animalistic peoples (was *Tengu*).

### Added

- **Goblinkin** (goblins, kobolds) — the "monstrous small," a deliberate contrast to Small Folk.
- **The Made** (androids, automatons, homunculi) — constructed beings claiming a self.

### Notes

- Files renamed via `git mv` (`halfling`→`small-folk`, `half-orc`→`big-folk`, `tengu`→`beast-folk`). README, character creation, primer spec, gap analysis, and navigation updated. Expansion picks reframed as a future **Drowned** kindred (gillmen/merfolk-kin/undine/sahuagin-touched) and **Planetouched** kindred (tieflings/aasimars).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-17

Added the third character pillar: **Ancestries**.

### Added

- **Part Seven — Ancestries** — who you are, before the dice. Mechanics-free, grounded in the Pathfinder *Golarion* Shackles, with an opening set of six peoples covering all five social positions from the design guide: **Shackleborn**, **Bonuwat**, **Chelaxian**, **Half-Orc**, **Halfling**, and **Tengu**. Each has a lore block, three world-anchored background questions, names with conventions, and a d20 trinkets table. The folder is extensible; the index lists strong next picks (Gillman, Tiefling, inland Mwangi, Grippli, Undine, sahuagin-touched).

### Changed

- **Renumbered** to slot Ancestries in as the third pillar (after Classes, before Character Creation): Character Creation → **Part Eight**, Equipment & Resources → **Part Nine**, Ships & the Sea → **Part Ten**, Ports/Havens/Haunts → **Part Eleven**, Location Tiers → **Part Twelve**. README, character creation, the ships intro, the primer spec, the cohesion gap analysis, and all navigation footers updated to match.
- **Cohesion gap analysis** updated: Ancestries marked resolved (opening set), with remaining expansion picks noted; build order advanced to Running the Game next.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-17

Added character creation and an honest map of what's still missing.

### Added

- **Part Seven — Character Creation** ("Make Your Pirate") — the build walkthrough (concept → class → calling → ancestry → resistances → bonds → crew/ship/home port → finish), an Advancement section (beats → minor/major/zenith advances), and a one-glance Quick Reference.
- **Appendix: [cohesion gap analysis](System%20Reference/appendices/cohesion-gap-analysis.md)** — a chapter-level comparison against Heart's structure identifying what the master still needs to be self-contained: **ancestries** (designed but unwritten), a **Running the Game / GM chapter**, an **adversary bestiary** (only ships are statted today), consolidated **healing & character-scale combat**, **worked landmarks/gazetteer**, a **quick-reference page**, and the **character sheet** in-tree — with a suggested build order.

### Changed

- **Renumbered** the back half to slot character creation into the player-facing block: Equipment & Resources → **Part Eight**, Ships & the Sea → **Part Nine**, Ports/Havens/Haunts → **Part Ten**, Location Tiers → **Part Eleven** (history preserved via `git mv`). README, cross-references, the primer spec, and all navigation footers updated to match.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

Reframed the project from a player primer into the **master system reference**. The six-part player reference was the wrong scope — it is now the player-facing *subset* of a complete ruleset.

### Changed

- **Renamed `Player Reference/` → `System Reference/`** (history preserved via `git mv`) and reframed it as the master ruleset. The README now marks each part's primer-eligibility (✅ player / ◑ partial / ⚙️ full-system & GM).

### Added

- **Part Seven — Equipment & Resources** — the full equipment, quality, tag, resource, and haggling rules (Part Two keeps a condensed summary that now links here).
- **Part Eight — Ships & the Sea** — Ships of the Shackles (engagement ladder, chaos die, fittings), the Hull track, and Journeys at Sea.
- **Part Nine — Ports, Havens & Haunts** — landmarks, journeys, haunts, removing stress by track, and bonds.
- **Part Ten — Location Tiers** — regional danger 0–4, default stress, rewards, statblock template.
- **Appendices** — a curated index of the design frameworks, balance reviews, and draft trails behind the rules (links, not copies).
- **`Shareable Editions/`** — `player-primer-content-spec.md` (what goes into a shareable primer, what stays out, and Discord/mobile format guidance) and `design-language.md` (the original document's per-category colour system, exact domain palette, typography, and reusable CSS tokens, synthesized with the aged-sea-chart brief).

### Notes

- Folded system docs had their "status: drafted" provenance lines trimmed; their design reasoning is preserved in the Appendices index.
- Navigation footers regenerated across all 36 reference pages for the expanded structure.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-17

First version-controlled build. The old 145-page PDF player reference was rebuilt as a six-part Markdown project under `Player Reference/`, assembled from the latest canonical sources, and the repository was initialized.

### Added

- **Repository** initialized at the project root with `.gitignore` (excludes PDFs, `.obsidian/`, OS cruft) and this changelog.
- **Player Reference** — a six-part player-facing document mirroring the original primer's structure, with prev/next/contents navigation footers on every page:
  - **Primer** and **Part One — The World** — setting and tone carried forward from the original PDF (the Shackles, the Free Captains, the Eye of Abendego, the crew).
  - **Part Two — The System** — the core D10 roll, stress & fallout (D12 vs. total), the four timing gates, and a full equipment + tag glossary.
  - **Part Three — Skills & Domains** — the eleven skills and nine domains.
  - **Part Four — Stress Tracks** — Blood, Tide, Reputation, Luck, Gold, with full fallout tables.
  - **Part Five — Callings** — eight callings plus the shared Piracy calling, with a shared-rules and calling-choosing guide.
  - **Part Six — Classes** — all ten classes, with the balance summary.
- **Project sources** committed as a baseline: class Versions 2–5, callings Passes 1–3, system documents, and Heart reference notes.

### Canonical sources used

- **Classes** — `Game System/Version 5/` (the play-style rebalance: combat floor enforced, social/knowledge spikes trimmed, party healing spread across five classes).
- **Callings** — `Ideation/Pass 3 - Callings/` (the story-arc rebuild; every core ability reworked to Heart-grammar in the core-ability workshop). Chosen over the older Pass 2 ("v2").
- **Core** (skills, domains, stress tracks) — `Ideation/Pass 1 - Concepts/`, with the 2026-06-10 errata applied (pure-Heart fiction-scoped timing, equipment-tag conformance, Wyrd→Tide remap).

### Notes

- Non-player-facing "Design Notes" sections were stripped from the copied class files; the reference contains only player-facing rules and flavour.
- Ship-scale systems (Hull, Journeys, Ship Combat, Ships of the Shackles), Ports & Haunts, Location Tiers, and the full Equipment & Resources document remain in the wider project and are referenced from the reference where relevant.
